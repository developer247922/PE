<<if not $minigames.dreamgame.playedToday>>\
	You walk as quietly as you can to $guardian's room and open the door. Her gentle, deep breathing assures you she's asleep. It's difficult to see in here.
	<<set $minigames.dreamgame.playedToday to true>>\
<<endif>>\

	<<if $player.alarmClockGuardian and ($time.hour gt $time.guardian.wakeHour or ($time.hour eq $time.guardian.wakeHour and $time.minute gte $time.guardian.wakeMinute))>>\
		A shrill beeping startles you, and you realize $guardian's alarm clock is going off.  You quickly duck out of the bedroom before she opens her eyes.
	<<else>>\
		You suddenly realize that $guardian's breathing has stopped, and fearing that she knows you're there, you quickly and quietly tip-toe out.

	You don't want to press your luck any further, so you quietly tip-toe out of $guardian's bedroom.
