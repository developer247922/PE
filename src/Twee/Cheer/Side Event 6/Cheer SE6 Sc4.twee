	$cheerFriend.name looks at you curiously when you say Rachel.

	@@.cheerFriend;“I get it,”@@ she says, kicking her feet aimlessly. @@.cheerFriend;“Rachel is, like, super hot, but I’m not really sure you’re her type.”@@

	@@.heroT;“I’m not even sure Rachel has a type,”@@ you say with a shrug. @@.heroT;“She always seems too focused on cheer for that kind of stuff.”@@

	@@.cheerFriend;“Wait. You didn’t pick her because she’s, like, super unobtainable, did you?”@@

	Your brief silence is enough to earn a smack on the arm. @@.cheerFriend;“And here I was trying to be all serious,”@@ $cheerFriend.name scolds as you performatively rub your arm where she hit you.

	$cheerFriend.name raises an eyebrow when you respond with Ashley’s name.

	@@.cheerFriend;“Really?”@@ $cheerFriend.name asks. @@.cheerFriend;“Ashley? Are you a masochist or something?”@@

	@@.heroT;“Maybe I just like dominant women,”@@ you tease.

	@@.cheerFriend;“Jeez. I try to ask a serious question, and you give, like, the worst answer possible. Can you even imagine if you were dating her? She’d basically treat you like a slave. I bet she’d even do stuff like make you hold all her bags when she went on shopping trips or feed her dinner when you went to a nice restaurant. Gross.”@@

	<<if $kink.humiliation>>\
		For a brief moment, your mind is filled with images of serving Ashley as she drags you along on a “date,” and you feel your cock stiffening at the visions of your servitude.

 	$cheerFriend.name thinks for a bit. @@.cheerFriend;“Though, i guess if you were into being someone’s slave, she would make a pretty hot mistress.”@@

	You chuckle, losing yourself for a moment in a fantasy of “Mistress Ashley.”
<<else>>\
	Desperate to maintain your cover as a girl, you tell $cheerFriend.name that you only like guys.

	She groans. @@.cheerFriend;“You couldn’t even answer the question?”@@ she complains.

	You start to try to cover your ass, but $cheerFriend.name cuts you off. @@.cheerFriend;“Don’t worry about it. It was just a dumb question anyways.”@@ She smiles. @@.cheerFriend;“I guess it does mean that we’ll just have to find you a boyfriend.”@@

	@@.heroT;“Oh, I am so not ready for that,”@@ you say, finally getting $cheerFriend.name to respond with a laugh.

After several more minutes of enjoying each other’s company, $cheerFriend.name says she has to get home and offers to drop you off somewhere on the way.
