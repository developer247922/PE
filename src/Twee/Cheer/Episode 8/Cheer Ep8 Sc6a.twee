	@@.heroT;“Let’s play another game,”@@ you say as you take her hand, dragging her off to “Desperate Dilemma,” a game where you use plastic guns to shoot targets on a screen. You start the game, and the two of you are quickly blasting baddies together.

	You and $cheerFriend.name explore the entire arcade playing together, sometimes competitively, sometimes cooperatively. $cheerFriend.name seems to be enjoying playing with you, laughing along as you play through all your favorites.

	@@.cheerFriend;“You know,”@@ $cheerFriend.name says as she waits for her turn on the space shooter game “Galactica,” @@.cheerFriend;“I’m actually having a lot of fun.”@@

	@@.heroT;“Huh?”@@ you ask, a bit distracted dodging enemy fire in the game.

	@@.cheerFriend;“Playing video games with my brother at home always kind of sucked. If we played something competitive, he’d always gloat when he won, and if we worked together, he’d pout if I didn’t do good enough.”@@

	You fail to avoid an incoming missile and your ship explodes, meaning it’s now $cheerFriend.name’s turn. You move over, giving her access to the joystick.

	@@.heroT;“Sounds like he takes gaming way too seriously.”@@

	@@.cheerFriend;“For sure, but I’m really enjoying playing with you. Plus, being at the arcade is just more fun than using a controller at home.”@@ You hear her ship blow up, and she groans. @@.cheerFriend;“Damn. That was my last life.”@@ She turns back from the game to face you.\

	@@.heroT;“You owe me dinner!”@@ you announce, hoping to leverage it into a date later.

	@@.cheerFriend;“Ok,”@@ $cheerFriend.name says with a shrug as she starts to walk off. After a few steps, she turns around, looks at you, and says @@.cheerFriend;“Well, c’mon!”@@ 

	@@.heroT;“Huh?”@@ you ask as you scurry up behind her. @@.heroT;“Where are we going?”@@

	@@.cheerFriend;“Dinner, obviously,”@@ she says as she leads you to the snack bar. @@.cheerFriend;“Two slices of pizza please!”@@ she asks the attendant.

	@@.heroT;“Well, I was thinking about perhaps later…”@@

	@@.cheerFriend;“Don’t worry about it,”@@ $cheerFriend.name says, taking the pizza from the attendant. @@.cheerFriend;“Better I pay up now before I forget.”@@

	She walks over to a long folding table and sits in one of the plastic chairs, placing your slice of pizza across from her. You shrug and sit across from her, taking a large bite of the pizza she bought you. The crust is limp and oddly wet, while the congealed, oddly cold cheese is intensely off putting. Even the pepperoni, usually the saving grace of crappy pizza, is bland and flavorless, coming off more like bologna. 

	@@.cheerFriend;“Gross,”@@ $cheerFriend.name as she makes a face and drops her food back on her plate.

	“@@.heroT;Oh, thank God it wasn’t just me,”@@ you say as you also plop your food back on the table.

	@@.cheerFriend;“How do you mess up pizza?”@@ she asks, laughing. @@.cheerFriend;“It’s like, the one thing you’re not supposed to be able to mess up.”@@

	@@.heroT;“I don’t know,”@@ you say, giving the pizza one last cautious sniff, @@.heroT;“but they definitely did.”@@
