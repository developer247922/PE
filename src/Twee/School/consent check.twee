$teacher looks at you sternly.  @@.teacher;"I can not believe that you would <<if $flags.tuitionFail>>fail to pay me<<else>>disobey like this<<endif>>, after expressing such interest in my tutelage. I have a suitable remedy in mind, but I warn you, it may involve a trip to the clinic or an extreme show of your devotion and submission. If you feel this is too much for you, let me know, and we will find an alternate punishment for you, something a little more tame."@@
