:: Therapist Finish Watching Alternative
@@.therapist;"Our hour is almost up,"@@ she says. @@.therapist;"How are you feeling?"@@
 
An hour?  You swear it was just a few moments ago that you started watching, but you check the clock on the wall, and she's right. You must have really zoned out watching... that... what were you watching again? It's hard to remember.
 
You stumble towards the door of her office, still feeling dazed. You assure $therapist you're ok, and she makes some notes.
